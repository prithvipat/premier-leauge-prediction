# ⚽ Premier League Match Winner Predictor

### 🧠 Predict outcomes of Premier League matches using machine learning and real-world football data

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning-based model that predicts the outcome of English Premier League (EPL) matches. It leverages historical match data to identify patterns based on team performance, form, and match attributes. The goal is to showcase how data science and predictive modeling can be used in sports analytics.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML pipeline development: from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and optional app deployment.
